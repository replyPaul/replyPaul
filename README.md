🚀 About Me
Exploring embodied intelligence, neuro-symbolic AI & autonomous systems for real-world impact.


👋 Hi, I’m a **human-centered technologist** and **interdisciplinary visionary**, actively shaping the future of intelligent systems and emerging technologies. I don’t fit the traditional coder archetype—and I never aimed to. My journey spans two decades across diverse yet interconnected IT areas in:

🧠 Interaction Design & Development • Front-End Architecture • Usability Engineer  
🌍 Enterprise Product Innovation Strategy (Techno-Functional Design) • Customer & User Experience
🎨 Multimedia Design • 3D Modeling • Games Design • Computer Graphics Engineer

This eclectic curiosity-driven path has fueled my evolution into a senior practitioner in **technical architecture** and **design consultancy**,
