# 👋 Hi, I'm Paul Biswa

## 🚀 AI Product & Engineering Leader | Cognitive Architecture Specialist

**Building autonomous AI systems that reason, decide, and act** through neuro-symbolic intelligence.

A visionary technologist with 20 years transforming frontier technologies into enterprise solutions. I architect **cognitive intelligence frameworks** that add reasoning layers to traditional systems—making them both precise *and* adaptive across cyber, space, industrial, and autonomous domains.

Drawing inspiration from Leonardo da Vinci and Nikola Tesla, I believe breakthrough innovation emerges from hands-on interdisciplinary exploration and tackling problems others consider too risky.

### **Cognitive Defense Architecture - Autonomous Threat Intelligence**

Pioneering neuro-symbolic system demonstrating how **cognitive reasoning enhances traditional security** through intelligent fusion:

**🎯 The Innovation:**
- Not *Traditional security = precise but brittle (can't handle novel threats)*
- Not *Pure AI = adaptive but unreliable (hallucinations, no guarantees)*
- **My Solution: Neuro-symbolic Fusion** combining dual strengths with **Reasoning** and **Explainibility**

**📊 Results:**
- **95% overall detection accuracy** with **85% novel/zero-day threat detection**
- **65% false positive reduction** through explainable causal reasoning
- **100% transparent decisions** - every classification has full audit trail
- **Cross-domain applicability** - same architecture works for finance, cyber, space, healthcare, industrial IoT,..

**🏗️ Architecture:**
```
Traditional Security    →    Cognitive Enhancement
