- 👋 Hi, I’m @replyPaul, an emerging tech enthusiast. Although I don't fit the traditional coder archetype, I have always explored a variety of roles throughout my career, including interaction designer, multimedia designer, game developer, computer graphics engineer, front-end developer, usability engineer, human-centered designer, and user/ cust. experience architect. Over time, I have transitioned into senior practitioner roles in front-end technical architecture and design consultancy, continuously evolving by learning, unlearning and relearning.

- 🌱 Currently, I am deepening my knowledge of LLM applications and experimenting with genAI technologies to harness the capabilities of modern AI for my innovative ideas & initiatives.

- 👀 My interests lie in leveraging innovation and DeepTech to advance AI and emerging technologies for Good, systemic design for societal challenges, and fields such as Computer Vision (CV), Augmented Reality (AR), Large Vision Models/Large Multimodal Models, and the Internet of Things (IoT).
  
- 💞️ I am eager to collaborate partially on social entrepreneurship projects or groundbreaking ideas in commercial sector.

- 📫 If interested, you can reach me via LinkedIn.
