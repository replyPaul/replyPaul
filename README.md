## About Me

# 👋 Hi, I'm Paul Biswa

## 🚀 AI Product & Engineering Leader | Autonomous Cognitive Intelligence Architect

A visionary technologist and π-shaped leader with 20 years transforming frontier technologies into enterprise solutions. I architect autonomous AI systems that plan, decide, and act—bridging deep technical expertise with product strategy and human-centered design.

Drawing inspiration from Leonardo da Vinci and Nikola Tesla, I believe breakthrough innovation emerges from hands-on interdisciplinary exploration and tackling problems others consider too risky.
