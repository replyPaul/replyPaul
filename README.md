- 👋 Hi, I’m @replyPaul, an AI enthusiast. While I don't fit the archetype of a traditional coder, I have explored diverse roles throughout my career, including UI/UX designer, game developer, computer graphics engineer, front-end developer, interaction designer, usability engineer, and experience architect. Over time, I have transitioned into senior practitioner roles in technical and design consultancy.

- 🌱 Currently, I am deepening my knowledge of LLM applications and experimenting with genAI technologies to harness the capabilities of modern AI for my innovative ideas & initiatives.

- 👀 My interests lie in AI for Good, systemic design to address societal issues, and also areas such as Computer Vision (CV), Large Vision Models/ Large Multimodal Models , Augmented Reality (AR), and Human-Centered AI (HCAI).

- 💞️ I am eager to collaborate on social entrepreneurship projects or groundbreaking ideas in commercial sector.
