## About Me

👋 Hi, I’m a **human-centered technologist** and **interdisciplinary visionary thinker**, actively exploring deep tech and science to shape the future of intelligent systems. 

- I don’t fit the traditional coder archetype—and I never aimed to. As an AI Product Leader and Strategist, my **hands-on experience in AI is primarily driven by curiosity and the necessity of team leadership for productive cross-collaboration**. 
- My earlier hands-on experience in IT Solutions Architecture (before AI) was primarily shaped by the demands of a Forward Deployed Engineer (FDE) during client-facing engagements and as a Distinguished Front-End Engineer.
- I have worn multiple hats and played various roles in parallel for diverse international consultations in **Product Innovation Strategy, Management and Vision**; **Pre-Sales**; **Techno-Functional Design**; and **Customer Experience (CX) / User Experience (UX) Consultation**.
