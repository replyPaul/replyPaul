🚀 About Me: 
Exploring embodied intelligence, neuro-symbolic AI and autonomous cognitive systems for real-world impact.


👋 Hi, I’m a **human-centered technologist** and **interdisciplinary visionary**, actively exploring deeptech & science to shape the future of intelligent systems. 
   I don’t fit the traditional coder archetype—and I never aimed to - my hands-on primarily driven by curiosity and augemnt team management or FDE demands during client facing engazements. 
   My **earlier** journey spans across diverse yet interconnected IT areas in:

🧠 Interaction Design & Development • Front-End Architecture • Usability Engineering • UI & Information Architecture • SEO & FEO in few projects
🌍 Enterprise Product Innovation Strategy (Techno-Functional Design) • End to end Customer & User Experience (CX & UX)
🎨 3D Modeling • Multimedia Design • Computer Graphics Engineering • Games Design 

This **eclectic curiosity-driven path** has fueled my evolution into a senior practitioner in **technical architecture** and **design consultancy**,
