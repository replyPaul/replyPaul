- 👋 Hi, I’m @replyPaul, an emerging tech enthusiast. Although I don't fit the traditional coder archetype, I have always explored a variety of roles throughout my career, including interaction developer & designer, 3D multimedia designer, games developer, computer-graphics engineer, front-end developer, usability engineer, human-centered designer, and customer experience architect. Over time, I have transitioned into senior practitioner roles in front-end technical architecture and design consultancy, continuously evolving by learning, unlearning and relearning.

- 🌱 Currently, I am deepening my knowledge of LLM applications and experimenting with genAI technologies to harness the capabilities of modern AI for my innovative ideas & initiatives.

- 👀 While actively expanding my knowledge of emerging technologies like AI, CV, IoT, Robotics, Material Science, Green Energy  and AR/VR, I am passionate about identifying and integrating these learning to enrich my innovation strategies and drive impactful product development, ensuring that aligns with practical, real-world applications.
  
- 💞️ I am eager to collaborate partially on social entrepreneurship projects or groundbreaking ideas in commercial sector.
