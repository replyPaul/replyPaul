About Me: 
👋  Hi, I’m a **human-centered technologist** and **interdisciplinary visionary**, actively exploring deeptech & science to shape the future of intelligent systems. 
    I don’t fit the traditional coder archetype —and I never aimed to. My hands-on work is primarily driven by curiosity and shaped by team leadership or FDE (Forward Deployed Engineer) kinda demands during client-facing engagements.

🌍  My **two-decade journey** spans diverse yet interconnected domains across IT, design, and innovation: 

🧭  **Strategy, Experience & Business Design** • Product Innovation Strategy & Management • Pre-Sales & Techno-Functional Design • FDE Consultation • Customer Experience (CX) & User Experience (UX)  

🧠  **Design Systems & Engineering** • Interaction Design & Front-End Development • UI Architecture & Information Architecture • SEO & FEO (Front-End Optimization) • Usability Engineering • Design Leadership & Systemic Design • Diverse Thinking Principles  • Sustainibility in Design

🎨  **Visual & Immersive Media** • 3D Modeling and Computer Graphics Engineering • Graphic Design • Games Design 

This **eclectic curiosity-driven path** has fueled my evolution into a senior practitioner in **technical architecture** and **design consultancy**,
