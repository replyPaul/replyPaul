About Me: 
👋  Hi, I’m a **human-centered technologist** and **interdisciplinary visionary thinker**, actively exploring deeptech & science to shape the future of intelligent systems. 
    I don’t fit the traditional coder archetype —and I never aimed to. As an AI Product Leader and Strategist, my hands-on in AI is primarily driven by curiosity and team leadership necessity for productive cross-collab. 
    My earlier hands-on in IT Solutions Arch ( before AI) were promarily shaped by FDE (Forward Deployed Engineer) kinda demands during client-facing engagements and as a Distingusied front-end engineer.
    Wore multiple hats or played multiple roles in parallel for **Product Innovation Strategy, Vision and Management**  •  Pre-Sales; Techno-Functional Design •  Consultation in Customer Experience (CX) / User Experience (UX).
